I dreamed that I was in my room
when much to my surprise,
I found that if I flapped my arms
it made me start to rise.

I waved my arms a little more
and floated off the ground,
I rose up to the ceiling
and I had a look around.

I flapped around my bedroom
then decided what I’d do:
I opened up my window,
waved my arms, and out I flew!

I flew around the city
with surprising grace and ease.
I sailed along the rooftops
and I soared among the trees.

I chased a pair of pigeons
’round the playground in the park.
I raced beside a robin
and cavorted with a lark.

And when I tired of flying
and decided I should rest,
I joined a sleeping eagle
for a nap inside his nest.

I woke confused this morning,
and I had to scratch my head,
for underneath my covers
I found feathers in my bed.

I’m covered in calamine lotion
from forehead on down to my feeters
to stop me from scratching the itches
of hundreds of bites from mosqueeters.

My arms and my legs are so itchy,
they feel like they’re starting to smoke.
I guess that I got that from playing
in patches of red poison oak.

As if it could not be more painful,
my stomach is rashy and hivy,
my back and my sides are all blotchy,
from wandering through poison ivy.

Despite that I’m itching like crazy,
I hardly can wait until when,
my itches and rashes are better
so I can go camping again!

My parents have canceled our summer vacation.
We won’t take our road trip and travel the nation.
We’re staying at home for the total duration,
and will not be leaving this single location.
They said that the name of this strange situation
is something that’s known as a family “staycation.”

You might think that I would be feeling frustration
or some other similar sorry sensation.
But I’m feeling nothing but joy and elation,
and giving my parents standing ovation.
You see, what this means is, by my calculation,
I’ll have the whole summer to play my Playstation.

I had to get a haircut.
It was looking much too long.
I let my sister cut it.
I mean, what could she do wrong?

She clipped some bald spots here and there.
She whacked the sides a little.
And then she shaved a three-inch stripe
directly down the middle.

She chopped some sections super short,
left others long and wild,
then shaved one eyebrow off before
she looked at me and smiled.

I don’t think that I’ll let her
give me haircuts anymore.
Or maybe I’ll just wait a while;
at least until she’s four.

You’re not supposed to touch your face,
but put your hands some other place,
to keep yourself from catching cold.
At least that’s what I’m often told.

They say that you can touch your thigh,
but never, ever wipe your eye.
It’s fine to touch your knee or shin,
but keep your fingers off your chin.

We ate all the Cheetos
and all the Doritos
and all of the chocolates and cheese.
We still have some greens
and a can of sardines
and some pickles and parsnips and peas.

My cat knows karate.
My frog knows kung fu.
My poodle knows judo.
My turtle does too.

They all became black belts
by watching TV;
some Chuck Norris movies,
and films with Bruce Lee.

They liked learning lessons
from Jean-Claude Van Damme,
and acting like action-film star
Jackie Chan.

They practiced their punches,
their blocks, and their kicks
until they were masters
of martial arts tricks.

You’d think they’d be good now
at guarding our house,
but, yesterday morning,
they ran from my mouse.

My mouse is a crack-up.
I laughed at his prank.
Do you think it’s weird that
my mouse drives a tank?

Mackenzie put a whoopie cushion
on the teacher’s chair.
Makayla told the teacher
that a bug was in her hair.

Alyssa brought an apple
with a purple gummy worm
and gave it to the teacher
just to see if she would squirm.

Elijah left a piece of plastic
dog doo on the floor,
and Vincent put some plastic vomit
in the teacher’s drawer.

Amanda put a goldfish
in the teacher’s drinking glass.
These April Fool’s Day pranks
are ones that you could use in class.

Before you go and try them, though,
there’s something I should mention:
The teacher wasn’t fooling
when she put us in detention.

There’s Sonic the Hedgehog
and Dragon Ball Z,
and Mario Party,
and Madden for Wii,
and FIFA 18 for the
Playstation 3.
They’re littered and strewn all around.

There’s Kidz Sports and Kirby
and Kingdom Hearts II,
Jurassic Park, Jeopardy,
Just Dance Wii U,
and don’t forget Pokemon
Red, Green, and Blue,
all over my desk and the ground.

They’re under my bed
in a battered old box.
They’re tossed in the closet
with Legos and blocks.
They’re stuffed in a drawer
with my undies and socks.
They’re thrown around every which way.

It’s kind a problem.
It’s sort of a shame.
It’s clearly my fault.
No one else is to blame.
The game I can’t locate
is always the same…
it’s the one that I’m wanting to play.

“Good morning, dear students,” the principal said.
“Please put down your pencils and go back to bed.
Today we will spend the day playing outside,
then take the whole school on a carnival ride.

“We’ll learn to eat candy while watching TV,
then listen to records and swing from a tree.
We’ll also be learning to draw on the walls,
to scream in the classrooms and run in the halls.

“So bring in your skateboard, your scooter, your bike.
It’s time to be different and do what you like.
The teachers are going to give you a rest.
You don’t have to study. There won’t be a test.

“And if you’d prefer for a bit of a change,
feel free to go wild and act really strange.
Go put on a clown suit and dye your hair green,
and copy your face on the Xerox machine.

“Tomorrow it’s back to the regular grind.
Today, just go crazy. We really don’t mind.
So tear up your homework. We’ll give you an A.
Oh wait. I’m just kidding. It’s April Fools’ Day.”

He naps on a virtual sofa.
He likes to chase virtual cats.
Whenever he’s good I reward him
with virtual dog treats and pats.

He’ll bring me the virtual paper.
He’ll chew on a virtual shoe.
There’s only one virtual problem.
I clean up his virtual poo.

My aunt calls me “Elizabeth.”
My grandma calls me “Liz.”
My sister calls me “Lisa,”
and the baby calls me “Wiz.”

My uncle calls me “Betty,”
while my grandpa calls me “Beth.”
My brother calls me “Dizzy Liz”
or sometimes “Lizard Breath.”

My teacher calls me “Betsy”
and my friends all call me “Bess.”
I find these nicknames more annoying
than you’d ever guess.

I wish that they would call me
by my real name instead.
I simply HATE those nicknames,
see, my real name is Fred.

My puppy punched me in the eye.
My rabbit whacked my ear.
My ferret gave a frightful cry
and roundhouse kicked my rear.

My lizard flipped me upside down.
My kitten kicked my head.
My hamster slammed me to the ground
and left me nearly dead.

So my advice? Avoid regrets;
no matter what you do,
don’t ever let your family pets
take lessons in kung fu.

I bought a Maserati
and a new Mercedes-Benz,
plus a brand new Lamborghini
I could show off to my friends.

I purchased a Ferrari
and an Aston Martin too,
and a Porsche and a Jaguar
and a BMW.

I had them all delivered
to my mansion in the hills.
I like to sit and look at them,
imagining the thrills.

For though it’s fun to be
the richest nine-year-old alive,
I’m sure I’ll like it better
when I’m old enough to drive.

He comes home in the morning
saying, “Man, I’m really dead!”
He kisses us goodnight, and then
by sunrise he’s in bed.

My mom heard my suspicion
and she said, “You’re not too swift.
Your father’s not a vampire.
He just works the graveyard shift.
